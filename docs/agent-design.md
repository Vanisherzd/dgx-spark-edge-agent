# Self-healing agent, first cut (2026-09-22)

Goal: given an injected fault, the agent must diagnose and repair it on its own using only the local model
(TensorRT-LLM on :8355, alias `edge-agent`), then verify. Later fault-injection cases plug into the same harness.

## Loop (`scripts/agent.py`)
observe (health URLs, container states) -> LLM with tools -> act -> observe ... -> `finish(status, root_cause, actions)`
-> independent verification (both health URLs 200). Thinking mode stays on (Nemotron reasons before each call);
temperature 0; at most 8 steps; every step (reasoning, tool, args, result, latency) is appended to `logs/agent/*.jsonl`.

## Tools = the whole action space
`check_health`, `docker_ps`, `docker_logs`, `docker_exec` (read-only diagnostics only, shell operators rejected),
`docker_start`, `docker_restart`, `read_config`, `write_config` (size-capped, must keep the proxy), `search_runbooks`
(keyword overlap over `runbooks/*.md`, the "small RAG"), `finish`. Everything is restricted to the two sandbox
containers and one config directory; `--dry-run` turns remediation into no-ops.

## Sandbox and faults (`scripts/faults.py`)
`edge-victim` (nginx front-end on 127.0.0.1:8880, config bind-mounted from `victim/conf.d`) and `edge-victim-app`
(upstream for `/api/`). Cases: `nginx-stopped` (container stopped), `bad-config` (missing semicolon, container exits on
start), `upstream-down` (502 on /api/). `faults.py run <case>` = reset -> inject -> agent -> verify -> PASS/FAIL.

## Not yet
Host-level actions (systemctl on the Spark itself), memory of past incidents, embedding-based retrieval, NemoClaw
skill packaging. Add each only when a fault case needs it.
