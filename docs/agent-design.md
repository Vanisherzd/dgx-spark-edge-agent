# Self-healing agent, first cut (2026-09-22)

Goal: given an injected fault, the agent must diagnose and repair it on its own using only the local model
(TensorRT-LLM on :8355, alias `edge-agent`), then verify. Later fault-injection cases plug into the same harness.

## Loop (`scripts/agent.py`)
observe (health URLs, container states) -> LLM with tools -> act -> observe ... -> `finish(status, root_cause, actions)`
-> independent verification (both health URLs 200). Thinking mode stays on (Nemotron reasons before each call);
temperature 0; at most 8 steps; every step (reasoning, tool, args, result, latency) is appended to `logs/agent/*.jsonl`.

## Tools = the whole action space
`check_health`, `docker_ps`, `docker_logs`, `docker_exec` (read-only diagnostics only, shell operators rejected),
`docker_start`, `docker_restart`, `read_config`, `write_config` (size-capped, must keep the proxy), `search_runbooks`
(keyword overlap over `runbooks/*.md`, the "small RAG"), `finish`. Everything is restricted to the two sandbox
containers and one config directory; `--dry-run` turns remediation into no-ops.

## Sandbox and faults (`scripts/faults.py`)
`edge-victim` (nginx front-end on 127.0.0.1:8880, config bind-mounted from `victim/conf.d`) and `edge-victim-app`
(upstream for `/api/`). Cases: `nginx-stopped` (container stopped), `bad-config` (missing semicolon, container exits on
start), `upstream-down` (502 on /api/). `faults.py run <case>` = reset -> inject -> agent -> verify -> PASS/FAIL.

## First results (2026-09-22, TensorRT-LLM + Nemotron-3-Nano NVFP4, thinking on)
| case | steps | what the agent did | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| nginx-stopped | 6 | docker_ps -> read_config -> docker_logs -> docker_start -> check_health -> nginx -t | PASS, ~55 s |
| bad-config | 7 | docker_ps -> read_config -> docker_start (fails) -> docker_logs (finds `[emerg]`) -> write_config (fixed semicolon) -> docker_restart -> check_health | PASS, ~70 s |
| upstream-down | 5 | docker_logs(app) -> read_config -> docker_ps -> docker_start(app) -> check_health | PASS, ~60 s |
All verdicts were `resolved` with a correct root cause; traces in `logs/agent/*.jsonl`. Run them again with
`uv run --no-sync scripts/faults.py run <case>`.

## Through NemoClaw (sandboxed OpenClaw agent) — `scripts/ops_api.py`
The sandbox has no docker and no host filesystem, so the host runs a small HTTP ops API (`uv run --no-sync
scripts/ops_api.py`, 0.0.0.0:8790) that exposes exactly the agent.py tool whitelist: `GET /tools` (schemas) and
`POST /call {"name","args"}`. Every call is appended to `logs/ops-api.log` (caller IP, tool, args, result). The
sandbox is allowed to reach it with one OpenShell rule:
```
openshell policy update edge-agent --add-endpoint host.openshell.internal:8790:read-write:rest \
  --add-allow host.openshell.internal:8790:GET:/tools --add-allow host.openshell.internal:8790:POST:/call \
  --binary /usr/bin/curl --binary /usr/bin/python3 --binary /usr/local/bin/node --rule-name ops-api --wait
```
Drill: `logs/nemoclaw-drill.sh <case>` = reset -> inject -> `nemoclaw edge-agent agent --agent main -m "<task>"` ->
verify -> print the ops-api call log. No auth on the ops API yet (docker-bridge reachability only); add a token before
exposing it further.

## NemoClaw drill findings (2026-09-22)
Driving the same fault through the NemoClaw sandbox agent (OpenClaw runtime, Nemotron via TensorRT-LLM) needed, in order:
1. the request-shape shim (`scripts/oai_shim.py`) — otherwise every follow-up turn is a 400;
2. a way to act on the host: `scripts/ops_api.py` (HTTP + MCP) plus the OpenShell endpoint rule; the model ignores
   "use curl" instructions and reaches for `docker`, so the tools must be real tools (MCP server `ops`) and/or a skill;
3. tolerance for small-model tool-calling slop, all handled server-side: missing `name`, `container` instead of `name`,
   arguments as JSON strings, and `write_config` content arriving with literal `\n` (double-escaped through OpenClaw's
   `tool_call` meta-tool) — that last one made a correct fix produce an unparsable one-line nginx.conf;
4. never let a tool bug drop the connection: OpenClaw pauses an MCP server after three `fetch failed`.
OpenClaw hides MCP tools behind `tool_search`/`tool_describe`/`tool_call` with long ids (`mcp:bundle-mcp:ops__docker_logs`);
Nemotron-3-Nano occasionally typos them. `self_heal` (one MCP call that runs the host loop) is the fallback when the
sandbox agent stalls. Run: `logs/nemoclaw-drill-mcp.sh bad-config` (drill script kept in `scripts/nemoclaw-drill.sh`).

## Not yet
Host-level actions (systemctl on the Spark itself), memory of past incidents, embedding-based retrieval, NemoClaw
skill packaging. Add each only when a fault case needs it.
